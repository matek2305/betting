This project is used to learn and practice techniques like Domain Driven Design, Event-driven architecture, CQRS, Event Sourcing and a lot more. I expect it to rapidly evolve over time as I will discover new things about mentioned toolset. The idea is to implement application that will allow its users to predict football matches results and have fun together during events like World Cup or Champions League.
